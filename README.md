LexiDrop operates on a **Bring Your Own Key** model. This means:

- **No Middleman**: Direct connection ensures speed and reliability.

### 🎯 **Physics-Based Dashboard**
Your captured words aren't just a list—they are interactive sticky notes that fall, bounce, and react to gravity. Drag them, throw them, and have fun with your study session.
